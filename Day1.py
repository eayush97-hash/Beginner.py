# Day 1
# Today i learned about print and statements. If i start a statement with a hash,
# It will execute as a comment.
# And by writing print in i can tell the computer that i just want to print the texts under "".
print("Hello World") #It is a example of that print command.

# I also learned that if i put \n at middlen of any string(the text under ""), it will print the text after this in a new line.
print("Hello\nWorld") #It is a example of that \n command.

# Thats all for today, as my fisrt session of python programming.
